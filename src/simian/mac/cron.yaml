# This YAML contains App Engine Scheduled Tasks / Cron Service configuration.
#
# Before making modifications, familiarize yourself with the following
# documentation.
#
# Simian crons download Apple Updates, auto-promote packages, generate and cache
# reports for the web UI, maintain the Datastore (i.e. remove cruft), and more.
#
# Default cron job execution frequency is tailored for small to medium sized
# deployments (100s to 1000s of clients).  In many cases, increased frequency
# will keep the web UI reports/etc. more up to date. Increased frequency
# may come at a greater cost, such as Datastore operations and potentially
# instance hours if clients aren't otherwise keeping instance running 24/7.
# For medium to large deployments, where clients are keeping instance warm 24/7,
# extra costs are likely to be minimal and unnoticed, thus max frequency is
# suggested. Max and min frequency suggestions are present in parenthesis
# suffixed to each cron description.
